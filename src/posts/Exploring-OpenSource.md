# What is open source?

## Overview ##
Open source is a term that originally referred to open source software (OSS). Open source software is code that is designed to be publicly accessible—anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they see fit.

Open source software is developed in a decentralized and collaborative way, relying on peer review and community production. Open source software is often cheaper, more flexible, and has more longevity than its proprietary peers because it is developed by communities rather than a single author or company.

Open source has become a movement and a way of working that reaches beyond software production. The open source movement uses the values and decentralized production model of open source software to find new ways to solve problems in their communities and industries

## How does an open source development model work?

An open source development model is the process used by an open source community project to develop open source software. The software is then released under an open source license, so anyone can view or modify the source code. 

Many open source projects are hosted on GitHub, where you can access repositories or get involved in community projects. Linux®, Ansible, and Kubernetes are examples of popular open source projects. 

At Red Hat, we use an open source software development model to create our enterprise open source products and solutions. Red Hat developers actively participate in hundreds of open source projects across the IT stack.

We start with community-built open source software that meets the needs, partially or fully, of our customers. Red Hat builds upon these open source projects, hardening security, patching vulnerabilities, and adding new enterprise features.

We then contribute these improvements back to the original project for the benefit of the community as a whole.

As customers use our software, they provide feedback, submit bug reports, and request additional features as their needs shift. This input guides Red Hat's development.

## Linux and open source

Linux is a free, open source operating system (OS), released under the GNU General Public License (GPL). It’s also become the largest open source software project in the world.

The Linux operating system was created as an alternative, free, open source version of the MINIX operating system, which was itself based on the principles and design of Unix.

Because Linux is released under an open source license, which prevents restrictions on the use of the software, anyone can run, study, modify, and redistribute the source code, or even sell copies of their modified code, as long as they do so under the same license.
