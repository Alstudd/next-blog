## **Why Doing Nothing is Actually One of the Best Things You Can Do**

When was the last time you did nothing?

By nothing, we mean absolutely nothing — no scrolling social media, no reading books or articles, no listening to podcasts, and no watching movies, TV, or YouTube videos.

Well, if you’re like many Americans, you’ll probably have to stop and think about it, because we don’t "do nothing" very often.

That doesn’t mean we aren’t busy buzzing about the importance of work-life balance and meditation, or busy touting the importance of relaxation — we are. But despite this trend, we’re still busier and more stressed-out than ever.

Even when we’re not working, many of us feel obliged to do something productive, be it going to the gym, running errands, going to a yoga class, or taking care of bills and other duties. We feel obliged to extract productivity out of every last nanosecond from our daily lives, assessing our worthwhileness as human beings by how successful we are in doing so.

And if we’re not busy running around, getting stuff done? Then we feel saddled with guilt.

It’s sad. But it’s not really our fault.

Our culture equates busyness with both high status and moral virtue. Lazing about and relaxing without talking on the phone, checking emails, or consuming books, podcasts, or articles, signals to the world that we aren’t as valuable as those who have a phone that’s blowing up, as intellectually engaged as those who are constantly consuming information, or as virtuous as those who always have their nose to the grindstone.

But buying into these myths can eat away at our sense of self and our overall quality of life. And it certainly can destroy our health, both mental and physical.

## **Eat Five Star, do nothing!**

The key to being mentally sharp, productive, and emotionally healthy is to allow your brain time to rest. When you allow yourself time to do nothing, you give your brain a chance to process experiences, consolidate memories, and reinforce learning.
